               Minc - Medical Image NetCDF

INTRODUCTION
------------
The Minc file format is a highly flexible medical image file format
built on top of the NetCDF generalized data format. The format is
simple, self-describing, extensible, portable and N-dimensional, with
programming interfaces for both low-level data access and high-level
volume manipulation. On top of the libraries is a suite of generic
image-file manipulation tools. The format, libraries and tools are
designed for use in a medical-imaging research environment : they are
simple and powerful and make no attempt to provide a pretty interface
to users.

Here's a list of some of the tools:

 * rawtominc, minctoraw, mincextract - format conversion
 * mincheader, mincdiff, mincinfo, minchistory - file information
 * mincedit, minc_modify_header - header manipulation
 * mincresample - arbitrary volume resampling
 * mincreshape - extraction of volume sub-cubes, image flipping,
      dimension re-ordering, type conversion
 * mincconcat - concatenating or interleaving images from multiple
      files
 * mincmath - perform simple math on files
 * minccalc - perform more complicated math on files through an expression
 * mincaverage - average minc files
 * mincstats - calculate statistics across voxels of a file
 * minclookup - lookup table operations for arbitrary re-mappings of
      intensities
 * worldtovoxel, voxeltoworld - coordinate conversion
 * xfmconcat, xfminvert - generalized transformation utilities
 * mincview - simple image display using xv or ImageMagick
 * mincpik - generate picture from slice through volume


Additional tools are available from the Montreal Neurological
Institute (MNI). These include register, a program designed for
manual, landmark-based volume registration using a tri-plane interface
that allows the user to roam simultaneously through two data volumes
plus the combined volume that overlays the data of the other two. Emma
is a minc interface to matlab (from The MathWorks) with functions to
facilitate image processing and display.  Mni_autoreg provides automated
registration, both linear and nonlinear.


GETTING MINC
------------
The minc package is available from

    http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/software/distribution/

Minc requires that the NetCDF package be built and installed first. It
is available through anonymous ftp from the Unidata Program centre at
the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (unidata.ucar.edu). 

For building and installation instructions, refer to the files
INSTALL.minc and INSTALL.
