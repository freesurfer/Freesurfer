  <description>
This program computes the overlap between two segmentation volumes. The following statistics can be calculated for each label:

      dice coefficient     -  F1-measure of the similarity between
                              the two labels.
      jaccard coefficient  -  Intersecting volume over the combined
                              volume of the two labels.
      volume difference    -  Fractional difference in volumes of
                              the labels.

By default, only dice scores are computed, but this can be reconfigured with the --measures flag.

Each structure in the input volumes will be considered by default, but an alternative list of labels can be specified with the -l flag. Additionally, the --seg flag will compute the overlap between the following 12 major anatomical structures:

      Hippocampus (17,53)
      Caudate (11,50)
      Putamen (12,51)
      Pallidum (13,52)
      Amygdala (18,54)
      Thalamus Proper (10,49)
      Lateral Ventricle (4,43)
      Third and Fourth Ventricles (14,15)
      Inf Lateral Vent (5,44)
      Cerebral White Matter (2,41)
      Cerebral Cortex (3,42)
      Accumbens Area (26,58)

  <optional>

    <argument>-o, --out [FILE]</argument>
    <explanation>Save detailed overlap report to a JSON file.</explanation>

    <argument>-m, --measures  [MEASURE...]</argument>
    <explanation>List of measures to compute. By default, only dice scores are computed. Options include: dice, jaccard, voldiff</explanation>

    <argument>-l, --labels  [LABEL...]</argument>
