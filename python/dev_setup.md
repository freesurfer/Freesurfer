# Dev Setup for Samseg Python Port

These instructions apply to a freshly built and upgraded machine running Ubuntu 16.04 and is intended as a reference guide. For a Linux system already set up for develpment, many of these steps can be skipped or appropriately altered.
## Create a dev environment:

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential \
            tcsh \
            libtool-bin \
            libtool \
            automake \
            gfortran \
            libglu1-mesa-dev \
            libfreetype6-dev \
            uuid-dev \
            libxmu-dev \
            libxmu-headers \
            libxi-dev \
            libx11-dev \
            libxml2-utils \
            libxt-dev \
            libjpeg62-dev \
            libxaw7-dev \
            liblapack-dev
sudo apt-get install git
```
Check the gcc compiler version:
```bash
gcc --version
```

Be sure to use the same compiler for building both ITK and GEMS2

Most recent _ITK_ requires cmake 3.95 or greater. Test with 

`cmake --version`.

Download and install `cmake-3.10.2-Linux-x86_64.sh`
You may need to copy it to standard location to get it working.
```
sudo cp -r bin /usr/
sudo cp -r doc /usr/share/
sudo cp -r man /usr/share/
sudo cp -r share /usr/
```
## Acquire Source Code
Create a working directory. This document this will refer to it as `~/work/cm`.
```bash
cd ~/work/cm
```
Get the latest release version of ITK:
```bash
git clone https://itk.org/ITK.git
```
Get the porting branch of FreeSurfer and install pybind11:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/innolitics/freesurfer.git
cd freesurfer
git checkout  nf-gems2-python-performance
cd GEMS2
git clone https://github.com/pybind/pybind11.git
```
## Build from Source
### Build ITK
```bash
cd ~/work/cm/ITK
git checkout release
cd ..
mkdir ITK-build
cd ITK-build
ccmake ../ITK
```
The complete ITK is not needed. You may turn off ```BUILD_TESTING```.

Using the ```t``` command allows you to see the complete set of options.
Then set the ```CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS``` and ```CMAKE_C_FLAGS``` to ```-msse2 -mfpmath=sse```.

The ```c``` command will configure and the ```q``` command will exit.
Now build the ITK library with
```bash
make -j4
```
## Python Setup
Install the python virtual environment tools:
```bash
sudo apt-get install python-pip
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install --user virtualenv
pip install --user virtualenvwrapper
```
To take full advantage add this to the end of your `.bashrc` file in your home directory:
```bash
export ITK_DIR=$HOME/work/cm/ITK-build
# where to store our virtual envs
export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/virtenvs
# where projects will reside
export PROJECT_HOME=$HOME/Projects-Active
# where is the virtualenvwrapper.sh
source $HOME/.local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
```
After changing `~/.bashrc` either open a new terminal or do a `source ~/.bashrc`

Locate the python 3 interpreter executable:
```bash
which python3
```
For purposes of this document ```/usr/bin/python3``` will the presumed location.

Now create a `gems2` virtual environment using the correct location of your python3:
```bash
mkvirtualenv gems2 -p /usr/bin/python3
```
The command prompt will indicate you are using this environment with a `(gems2)` prefix.
Having created `gems2` you can enter this environment in any terminal shell by using:
```bash
workon gems2
```
At this point any python packages installed will be local to that environment 
and not interfere with any other python projects, which is the purpose of using virtual environments.

Verify with:
```
which python
```
You should see something like `~/virtenvs/gems2/bin/python3`

### Build and install GEMS2python
In the GEMS2 directory run the ccmake utility
```
cd ~/work/cm/freesurfer/GEMS2
ccmake .
```
Use the `t` option to see the advanced mode options. Then set the `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS` and `CMAKE_C_FLAGS` to "`-fPIC -fpermissive -msse2 -mfpmath=sse`".

`BUILD_EXECUTABLES` `BUILD_GUI` `BUILD_MATLAB` `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` and `BUILD_TESTING` should be `OFF`.

Check that the `PYTHON_EXECUTABLE` and `PYTHON_LIBRARY` have valid values such as `/usr/bin/python3.5` 
and `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpython3.5m.so` respectively.

Build the GEMS2 code with:
```bash
cmake .
make -j4
```
The code just built can be installed into the virtual environment:
```bash
python setup.py bdist_wheel
```
The subdirectory ```dist``` should now have wheel file named something similar to ```GEMS2Python-0.1.0-cp35-cp35m-linux_x86_64.whl```
Install this file into the virtual environment:
```bash
pip install dist/GEMS2Python-0.1.0-cp35-cp35m-linux_x86_64.whl
```

### Build and install samseg
The python portion of the code can also be built and installed as a wheel:
```bash
cd ~/work/cm/freesurfer/python/
python setup.py bdist_wheel
pip install dist/samseg-0.1.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl
```
As a test that everything is correctly built, linked, and installed try the following command:
```bash
run_samseg
```
You should see a usage recipe plus an error complaining that no input was specified:
```bash
usage: run_samseg [-h] [-o FOLDER] [-i FILE] [--threads THREADS] [-r FILE]
                  [-m LABEL] [--showfigs] [--nobrainmask] [--diagcovs] [-v]
                  [-a]
run_samseg: error: must specify at least one input
```
## Test and Run

## Running Samseg Code
The matlab script `run_samseg.m` has been ported to `run_samseg_ported.py` with the same command line arguments. 

A minor difference is the use of `-i` and `-o` with single dash instead of `--i` and `--o`
Running with `-h` for help will print a complete usage statement:
```bash
usage: run_samseg [-h] [-o FOLDER] [-i FILE] [--threads THREADS]
                            [-r FILE] [-m LABEL] [--showfigs] [--nobrainmask]
                            [--diagcovs] [-v]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -o FOLDER, --output FOLDER
                        output to FOLDER
  -i FILE, --input FILE
                        input image(s) from FILE
  --threads THREADS     number of threads
  -r FILE, --regmat FILE
                        skip registration and read from FILE
  -m LABEL, --missing LABEL
                        LABEL is a missing structure (repeat for multiple
                        missing labels)
  --showfigs            show figures during run
  --nobrainmask         no initial brain masking based on affine atlas
                        registration
  --diagcovs            use diagonal covariance matrices (only affect multi-
                        contrast case)
  -v, --verbose         verbose debug output
```
## Running Test Scripts
Place the `innolitics_testing` data folder at `~/work/cm/`


The following will run test case 008 directly:
```bash
cd ~/work/cm/freesurfer
workon gems2
export SAMSEG_DATA_DIR=$HOME/work/cm/innolitics_testing/atlas/20Subjects_smoothing2_down2_smoothingForAffine2
run_samseg \
   -o $HOME/work/cm/innolitics_testing/python_temp_data/008 \
    -i $HOME/work/cm/innolitics_testing/buckner40/008/orig.mgz
```

## Development Cycle
If you will be actively developing the code you can uninstall, rebuild, and reinstall the wheels.
But there are some easier alternatives.

### Python Development Cycle
If you will be actively developing the python code then the ```samseg``` wheel can be installed in edit mode.
If you had previously installed it normally, then uninstall it now:
```bash
pip uninstall samseg
```
The project can instead be installed in edit mode.
```bash
cd ~/work/cm/freesurfer/python/
pip install -e .
```
Any changes to the python code will be automatically updated.

### C++ Develpment Cycle

A similar process is used if you will also be developing the c++ code.
If you have already installed the ```gems2``` wheel you should uninstall it:
```bash
pip uninstall gems2
```
Instead  add the gems2 binary to the PYTHONPATH:
```bash
export PYTHONPATH="$HOME/work/cm/freesurfer/GEMS2/bin"
```

### The PYTHONPATH alternative
It is also possible to uninstall either or both wheels and use the python path.
```
export PYTHONPATH="$HOME/work/cm/freesurfer/python:$HOME/work/cm/freesurfer/GEMS2/bin"
```
Note the use of ```:``` as separator. If you are keeping one of the wheels then remove the corresponding piece of the path.
