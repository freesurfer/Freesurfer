/**
 * @file  faster_variants.h
 * @brief define the macros that conditionalize faster variants of some algorithms
 *        before those variants completely replace the original variant
 *
 *        keep both variants when the faster variant is 
 *           1) not yet fully tested, or
 *           2) substantially more complex than the original
 *                  because comparing the two results can test the faster one for correctness
